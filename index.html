I am <b>very</b> interested in sports. My favorite teams are the New York Knicks, New York Giants, New York Rangers, and New York Yankees. I also support the Georgia Bulldogs football and basketball teams. The colors of my webpage are representative of this. I follow proffesional basketball and football very closely, and can name almost every player on every team in the NBA and NFL. I get most of my sporting information from 
<a HREF="http://www.espn.com/">ESPN.</a></p> 
<p>
My favorite book is <i>Harry Potter and The Sorceror's Stone</i>, My favorite show is <i>South Park</i>, and my favorite movie is <i>Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strkes Back</i>. I do not watch much television, as I dedicate a lot of time to following my favorite sports teams. Also, I find movies too long, and have a hard time watching them in one sitting. Another way I entertain myself is with video games, however, I don't have much time to play them with my busy schedule. Some of my favorite musicians are Kendrick Lamar and The Weeknd.
